        <p> Watering every plant manually is a very tedious and time-consuming job. In today’s day and age where time is a very limited resource, people don’t have time to look after their home gardens. Adding onto that problem each plant has different watering requirements hence care and attention is required while watering them. Also, when people go out on trips and there isn’t anyone present to care for the plants, hence they may wither away.
            The existing system doesn’t take into account the wagering requirement of different plants, hence in this project, we are developing a system that can fully automate the plant watering process and water the plants according to their needs.
